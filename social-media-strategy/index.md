        I have worked with multiple brands across paid and organic social media,
        developing a strong understanding of what drives results across different
        niches. One such brand was <strong>Milk by Mom</strong>, where the audience
        was highly targeted yet challenging to convert.
        <br><br>
        My focus is on brand tone, audience behavior, and intentional content
        planning to support reach, engagement, and conversions. Two ad performance
        screenshots are attached as proof.
